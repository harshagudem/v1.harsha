CrashPad Web App Project is a capstone project for my Masterâ€™s in Information Systems, developed by a team of four. It simplifies RV parking management with features for booking, space management, and payments. Using ReactJS, TypeScript, Java Spring Boot, MySQL, and AWS, I worked on the front-end. The project followed Agile methodologies for iterative development and continuous feedback.
